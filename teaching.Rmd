## Students and Research Team

I enjoy mentoring and working with students on masters and PhD level projects outside of the classroom. If you are a current student interested in my research, contact me! If you are a prospective student, please [apply to our graduate program](https://www.public-health.uiowa.edu/biostatistics-faq/) - our admission's committee carefully reviews each application to admit a cohort of students.

## Graduate Courses

I teach causal inference and introduction to longitudinal data analysis in the [Department of Biostatistics at the University of Iowa](https://catalog.registrar.uiowa.edu/courses/bios/). 

#### BIOS:6650 Causal Inference (Spring 2023, Spring 2024, Spring 2025)

Causal inference overview, emphasis on inference in observational research; conceptual issues (e.g., counterfactuals, causal graphs, time-varying treatments/confounding), methods (e.g., inverse probability weighting, doubly robust estimators), and related applications (e.g., causal mediation analysis, quantitative bias analysis); for advanced biostatistics or epidemiology students.

#### BIOS:6310 Introductory Longitudinal Data Analysis (Fall 2023, Fall 2024) 

Introduction to statistical models and estimation methods for outcome variables (normal and non-normal) clustered or measured repeatedly in time or space; focus on applications and computer software methods for ANOVA based methods, hierarchical linear models, linear mixed models, correlated regression models, generalized estimating equations, and generalized linear mixed models.
