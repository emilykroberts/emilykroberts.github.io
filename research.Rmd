I am currently building collaborations at the University of Iowa, particularly through our [Causal Inference Collaboratory](https://iphprp.org/opportunities/faculty/collaboratories/causal-inference/). I am involved in the [Clinical Trials Statistical through our Data Management Center and NeuroNEXT](https://neuronext.org/profile/emily-roberts-phd/). My main methodologic focus has been on methods for surrogate endpoints in clinical trials, and my general research interests include clinical trials, causal inference, survival analysis, longitudinal measures, Bayesian methods, futility analysis, biomarkers, and diabetes, neurologic, and cancer applications. At the University of Michigan, I began research on the NIH Cancer Training Grant in Biostatistics in 2016 and was an NSF Graduate Research Fellow. During my PhD, I was awarded the University of Michigan Department of Biostatistics Excellence in Research Award Honorable Mention. Recently, I was awarded at American Statistical Association Lifetime Data Science Paper Award as well as the Junior Faculty Opportunity Award and New Faculty Research Award at the University of Iowa.

Below is a list of my published projects. Please refer to my [Google Scholar page](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=yh2UbZEAAAAJ&hl=en) to get a complete list of my papers and presentations.
