Hi! I am an [assistant professor of biostatistics at the University of Iowa](https://www.public-health.uiowa.edu/people/emily-roberts/). Welcome to my page where I have included a bit about myself and my work. I'm excited about statistical methodology that can be meaningfully used in a clinical setting. 

I completed my PhD at the [Department of Biostatistics, University of Michigan](https://sph.umich.edu/biostat/) in 2022 with my PhD dissertation “Causal Inference Methods and Intermediate Endpoints in Randomized Clinical Trials”. I earned my MS in biostatistics from Michigan in 2018 and graduated Summa Cum Laude in 2016 from Coe College with a BA in mathematics and psychology. My passion for medical research and ultimate career goals stem from my diagnosis of type I diabetes at the age of four.
